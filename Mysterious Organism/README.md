# Mysterious Organism

### Quick Things To Note

+ This is a make-up project with real life applications.

  + In this project, I am part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near
  hydrothermal vents. My team names the organism, ***Pila aequor (P. aequor)***, and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA
  bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting
  specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and
  expensive. My job here is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for my research team to study.
  + DNA is comprised of four bases (Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine).
  + When `returnRandBase()` is called, it will randomly select a base and return the base ('A','T','C', or 'G').
  + `mockUpStrand()` is used to generate an array containing 15 bases to represent a single DNA strand with 15 bases.
  + `mutate()` is responsible for randomly selecting a base in the object’s dna property and changing the current base to a
  different base. Then `mutate()` will return the object’s dna.
  + P. aequor has a likelier chance of survival if their DNA is made up of at least 60% ***'C'*** or ***'G'*** bases.
  + This script returns 30 instances of pAequor that can survive in their natural environment.

+ This is a personal project from Codecademys' Full Stack Engineer Path.

  + I will make future improvements to the source code where necessary, please provide your feedback.
