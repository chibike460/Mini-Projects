# Mini Projects
 Some mini/side projects as i reinforce my Full Stack Engineering skills.

Hello, thank you for finding time to peruse my mini-projects repo; I hope you find any of these inspiring.
I will, from time to time, update this repo with side/mini-projects to keep track of personal practice while I consolidate. gain mastery of the complete Full Stack Career.

Please feel free to refactor or constructively critisize any work you find here. Particularly, please pay attention to any redundant logic that may exist.
